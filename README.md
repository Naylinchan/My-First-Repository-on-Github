My-First-Repository-on-Github
=============================
My name is Leland, I am new to Open source. I have some experience in Javascripting, C#, C++, HTML, and CSS. My programming is very limited and would like to expand my knowledge. I am very rusty on most programming language as I have not been coding for a few years now. Where can I start learning more about Javascripting beside youtube or W3schools. Is there a project or assignment I can work on to better my programming skills?
